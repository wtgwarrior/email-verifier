# Email Verification: The Key to a Successful Marketing Campaign

Here are 4 top reasons why you should verify your email address, no matter the nature of the campaign:

• Personalization: Making the user feel a part of the marketing campaign has become a necessity more than a luxury. The end customers are wary of the potential spam attacks happening in the cyber space and every email you send out is treated with utmost caution and suspicion. For this very reason, when you personalize an email, and involve the customer/end user, they feel a sense of involvement, which will give your campaign better grades as compared to a non- validated email.

• Reduced bounce rates: Unverified emails can be a bouncer, especially if you are trying to drive a successful marketing campaign. Imagine a situation, wherein, you send out 1000 emails automatically, and more than 700 or 800 emails are returned. This way, not only do you end up losing out on a large customer base, but also end up losing out on your reputation with Google. The higher the bounce rate, the more the chances of your email address being tagged as spam.

• Avoidance of spam traps: Many people often end up trapping repetitive email addresses as spam, which means your hard work is literally going into the trash, instead of the recipient’s inbox. If all your mails end up in the spam or the junk box, chances are your marketing campaign will be rendered ineffective in the long run. In order to keep your emails from being blacklisted in this manner, it’s imperative to have an Email Validation Service to check your recipient’s details before hand itself.

• Better usable leads: Once all your recipient email addresses have been verified, the chances of converting a potential customer into a valuable, permanent customer become higher. This would translate into a better opportunity for your campaign, as your services can cater to a wider audience in the long run.
